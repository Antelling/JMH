The actual julia bloom filter package hasn't been updated in like a year
and a half so only has support for 0.6

In the github there is support for julia 0.7. But, there's a fork of that
github repo that has 1.0 support. which is https://github.com/aj-monk/BloomFilters.jl and where I got this code from.

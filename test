In this study, we compare the performance of a set of population-based metaheuristics on the Multi-Demand Multidimensional Knapsack Problem (MDMKP), an NP-hard binary optimization problem. A genetic algorithm is compared to four different algorithms developed by Dr. Rao of the National Institute of Technology Surat: TLBO, Jaya, Rao1, and Rao2. These metaheuristics were originally developed for continuous non-linear problems, and so had to be adapted to the binary space. The effects of combining these global optimization techniques with local searches is explored. Additionally, different population sizes and methods of pruning the population are explored. A technique to generate initially feasible solutions to the MDMKP is proposed. A repair operator for the MDMKP is proposed. A metric to quantify the diversity of populations is proposed.
